I used it running a one hour long for loop function when [I was trying to bruteforce all the possible combination]() out of the unique code characters from the ICD-10-PCS XML file which has 880 tables and returned the output of 368,462 codes! Definitely the wrong way to do it, but ended up learning a lot from that process as well.\n",
